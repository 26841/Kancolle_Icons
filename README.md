**Repository Description:**
This repository contains manually-created icons based on the online game Kantai Collection.
Feel free to use the icons in this repository for personal purposes, such as avatars, Discord bots, etc. Please credit as you see fit.

**Icon Descriptions:**
All images are 250 by 250 png, and includes the facial portion of each kanmusu with the corresponding rarity card in the background.

**Repository Organization:**
The icons are divided into three folders:

**Base:**

The "normal" version of the icon, referring to the standard, non-damaged and non-holiday cg of each kanmusu. Each file is named
after the kanmusu name, including remodel types

**Damaged:**

The damaged, non-holiday cg of each kanmusu. Each file is named similarly to Base, with an addition of '_dmg' at the end

**Enemy:**

Contains icons for all enemy ships. Given the nature of how they are named on the wikia everything will be in this folder.
Forms with the same CG are treated as separate and named accordingly for convenience

**Special: WIP**

Contains all the holiday, event, etc. cgs of every kanmusu that has at least one. Icons are divided into subfolders which correspond to
a different event. Given the nature of this folder, 'base' and 'damaged' cgs are in the same folder, and the file names mirror those
in the Base and Damaged folders.

Some CGs used in some icons were used in Phase 1 and so far have not been in Phase 2. The original images are smaller and of lower quality than CGs that have been/currently are being used in Phase 2. Phase 1 exclusive CGs have been enlarged and enhanced by using http://waifu2x.udp.jp/

Some ships have multiple versions of the same seasonal cg. The most recent version is used. If you would like to see an older version let me know (see below)

Currently a work in progress, and as such it is not recommended incorporating this folder in any code until further update.

**Additionally**

See an icon that looks weird and could use fixing? Have a request? Raise an issue and let me know!
Update: The icon-making process needs some reworking so I will be redoing most to all of the base icons
